## Overview

The goal of the project was to design and develop a software tool for document organisation in scientific research. The application is a virtual space for grouping, sorting, reading and queuing articles with a DOI code. It was implemented only for Windows so far with the following tech stack: Python, Tkinter, SQLite, Pyinstaller, Inno Setup. The development process was a part of the author's master's thesis project.
